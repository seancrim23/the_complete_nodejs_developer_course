- essentially a large network of event listeners.... the server is waiting for the client to do something and vice versa. When either do something, then something will happen and the
	response will be sent to the other.

- Difference between the "io" connection and the "socket" connection

	- io - related to the ENTIRE SERVER. this can send messages/etc to anybody connected to the server
	- socket - related to the connection of ONE client, only can send/receive from that ONE client
	
- socket "broadcast" will send the data to EVERY CONNECTION EXCEPT for the singular user

- Event Acknowledgements 

	- exactly what they sound like, server sends the client an event and the client sends a message back to the server ACKNOWLEDGING it has been received
		(and vice versa)
		
-Linking together server with client.

	- (in my own words) - essentially the server and client are linked through emissions and waiting (on)
		- one side can "emit" some action that is based on a word (first param for emit) and the other side can wait (with "on") to figure
		out what to do when that action occurs
			ex. client wants to tell server about a new user
				socket.emit('newUser', userInfo, message (this message will come from the callback acknowledging the event happened)); - emitting "newUser" with the data about the user and waiting for something to handle it (the server)
				
				now the server will wait with a piece of code like so:
				socket.on('newUser', (userInfo, callback) => {
					...do something...
					
					callback('pass something here' (error, success message, etc.)) - this throws whatever message/object etc back to the original emit to be handled
				});
				
	- Essentially it comes down to one side throwing out some sort of data when something happens, then the other side handles it and does something with it
