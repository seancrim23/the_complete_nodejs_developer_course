OFFICIAL NODEJS DEFINITION/BLURB FROM WEBSITE:

	"Node.js is a Javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven,
	non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest
	ecosystem of open source libraries in the world."

- WHAT IS NODEJS???????

	- developers can use javascript now on the server side, rather than just on the front end.
	- v8 (c++) engine allows browsers, node to run, it translates code to vanilla javascript for the machine to run
		- essentially vanilla javascript has no idea how to do certain things (reading a file for example). this is why node passes this off to the
		v8 engine which then translates that code into c++ which can do what vanilla javascript cannot.
	
- SPECIFIC KEYWORDS/DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NODE AND VANILLA JS

	  - javascript "window" vs nodejs "global"
	  - javascript "document" vs nodejs "process"
	  
- WHY SHOULD WE USE NODEJS????????????????

	- non blocking i/o 
		- "non-blocking" - (asynchronous) while waiting for a response from some call, it can still do other things
		- uses this anytime it is trying to communicate with the outside world
			ex: querying a db, reading from a file system, making requests, etc
	-NPM!!! huge ecosystem containing open source libraries that can be used in node programs.
